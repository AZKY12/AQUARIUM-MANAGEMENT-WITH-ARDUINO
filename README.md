# Aquarium Management with Arduino

Welcome to the **Aquarium Management with Arduino** project! This project is designed to automate and monitor key parameters of an aquarium to ensure a healthy and optimal environment for aquatic life. The system includes multiple components like water level monitoring, light control, automatic fish feeding, and water temperature monitoring, all of which are managed using Arduino.

## Project Overview
The Aquarium Management system integrates sensors and actuators to automate routine tasks and provide real-time monitoring for aquarium owners. The system helps ensure that the aquarium's water levels, light, temperature, and fish feeding are maintained efficiently, reducing the need for manual intervention.

## Features
- **Water Level Monitoring:** Monitors the water level in the aquarium and alerts the user when it's low or high.
- **Aquarium Light Setup:** Controls the lighting system based on pre-configured timing and user preferences.
- **Automatic Fish Feeder:** Dispenses food to fish at scheduled intervals.
- **Water Temperature Monitoring:** Tracks the temperature of the water to ensure it stays within the optimal range for the aquatic life.

## Project Demo
Check out the Tinkercad project for a detailed simulation and hands-on interaction:

## Team Members

- **Azky Sarafath**: Water Level Monitor  
- **Abdul Kaiyoom**: Aquarium Light Setup  
- **Hanan Siddeek**: Automatic Fish Feeder  
- **Sifana SAF**: Water Temperature Monitoring  

## Components Used
- **Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)**
- **Water Level Sensor**
- **Temperature Sensor (e.g., DHT11 or DS18B20)**
- **Light Bulb and Relay Module**
- **Automatic Fish Feeder Mechanism**
- **Jumper Wires, Breadboard, and Power Supply**

## How It Works
1. **Water Level Monitoring**: The water level sensor continuously monitors the water level in the aquarium. If the water level falls below or rises above the desired range, an alert is triggered.
2. **Aquarium Light Setup**: The light system is controlled using a relay module, allowing you to turn the lights on/off or adjust the lighting schedule based on the time of day.
3. **Automatic Fish Feeder**: The fish feeder mechanism dispenses food at scheduled intervals, ensuring that fish are fed regularly without the need for manual feeding.
4. **Water Temperature Monitoring**: The temperature sensor continuously checks the water temperature and sends data to the Arduino, where it can be displayed or logged for future reference.

## How to Set Up
1. Connect the components to the Arduino board as shown in the Tinkercad simulation.
2. Upload the respective code for each system (water level monitor, light setup, fish feeder, temperature monitor) to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
3. Monitor the data from the sensors and enjoy the automated features in your aquarium!

## Future Enhancements
- Add Wi-Fi or Bluetooth capability to monitor the aquarium remotely.
- Integrate a mobile app for notifications and remote control.
- Use a camera module to capture aquarium images and monitor the condition of aquatic life.
